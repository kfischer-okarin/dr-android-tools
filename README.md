Tools for DragonRuby Android projects

## Setup
Clone this repository right into a dragonruby directory (i.e. next to the `dragonruby` binary) and execute
`setup-basic-enviroment` to download all basic tools for debugging and signing APKs into `./android`.

If you also want to compile C Extensions for Android then also execute `setup-cext-environment` afterwards.

## How to use
Each of the scripts has a `--help` flag with a short explanation.
